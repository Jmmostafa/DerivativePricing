This repository contains **quantitative finance models** for pricing derivatives in the **equity market**. While the primary focus is on **options**, the repository is designed to expand to **futures, swaps, and forwards** contracts.

## üìå Agenda / Goals

- Implement and compare **option pricing models**:
  - Black‚ÄìScholes (European, American)
  - Binomial / Trinomial tree models
  - Local & stochastic volatility models (Heston, SABR)
  - Jump-diffusion models
  - Monte Carlo simulations

- Compute **option Greeks** and risk measures for hedging and portfolio management.

- Extend to **other derivatives**: futures, swaps, forwards.

- Provide **interactive Python notebooks** with real market data examples.
